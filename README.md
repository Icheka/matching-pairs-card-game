The Memory Game That Will Keep You Guessing

Test your memory and reflexes with Match Pairs, the classic card game that is easy to learn but hard to master. Turn over two cards at a time to see if they match. If they do, you keep the cards and get to turn over two more. If they don't match, the cards are turned back over and you get another turn. Match all of the pairs to win and level up!
